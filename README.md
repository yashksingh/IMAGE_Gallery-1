# IMAGE_Gallery-1

## INTRODUCTION

Galleries are pages which contain large numbers of media content—almost always, images—with little or no supporting text. Large numbers of galleries have been deleted from Wikipedia per WP:NOT. This is usually cited in this context as WP:NOT an image gallery, which is a paraphrase of the official policy that Wikipedia articles are not mere collections of photographs or media files. There are, therefore, very few gallery-articles left on Wikipedia in the main article namespace (see [1]). This page defines how, when, and where gallery-articles should and should not be used. It is not concerned with the use of the gallery feature within pages that are predominantly text-based articles.
