# IMAGE_Gallery-1

## INTRODUCTION

Galleries are pages which contain large numbers of media content—almost always, images—with little or no supporting text. Large numbers of galleries have been deleted from Wikipedia per WP:NOT. This is usually cited in this context as WP:NOT an image gallery, which is a paraphrase of the official policy that Wikipedia articles are not mere collections of photographs or media files. There are, therefore, very few gallery-articles left on Wikipedia in the main article namespace (see [1]). This page defines how, when, and where gallery-articles should and should not be used. It is not concerned with the use of the gallery feature within pages that are predominantly text-based articles.

## BENEFITS

Benefits of galleries are disputed. There is general agreement that some galleries contribute important quality to the project but many do not. These benefits must be balanced against costs to determine if a gallery is warranted.

- Some topics are best illustrated by a gallery. As always, the best definition of a thing is the thing itself. Sometimes, one or even three images is not enough.
- Sometimes a gallery is a useful index into a large number of related articles. To claim this benefit, of course, each image in the gallery must link to a related article.
- The whole may be more than the sum of its parts. Occasionally, simply grouping a number of images together may reveal something of value to the reader, even if that value cannot be put into words. Common themes may unexpectedly appear—or expected themes fail to materialize.
- Projectspace galleries can be important tools, even if some images are never used outside of the gallery.
- Userspace galleries, like much userspace content, form part of the social glue that binds our community.
